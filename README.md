# TicketMaster Pro: Streamlined Ticket Management ðŸš€

Manage, track, and resolve support tickets effortlessly with this modern, responsive web application. Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Pinia, TicketMaster Pro offers a clean interface for users to oversee their ticket lifecycle, from creation to closure.
